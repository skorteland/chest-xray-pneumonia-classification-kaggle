# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Classifier

This project is a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Pytorch.

## Dataset
- [Kaggle Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- 5863 X-ray images in two categories (Pneumonia and Normal)

## Models
In this project relatively simple models were used as only a CPU was available for training.
In this project several models are investigated:
1. basic CNN model
2. basic CNN model with data augmentation
3. transfer learning with a pre-trained complex CNN model
